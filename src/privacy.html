<h1 id="privacy-statement">Privacy Statement</h1>
<p><em>Last updated: May 10, 2025</em></p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>AnduinOS is a free and open-source Linux distribution based on Ubuntu.<br>We are committed to protecting your privacy.<br>This document explains how AnduinOS handles user data, clarifies its technical design regarding privacy, and outlines considerations related to upstream components.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="1-data-collection-by-anduinos">1. Data Collection by AnduinOS</h2>
<p><strong>AnduinOS itself does not collect, transmit, or store any user data.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>All system operations, configurations, and user activities take place locally on your own device (&quot;local execution&quot;).</li>
<li>AnduinOS does not include any telemetry, analytics, advertising, tracking, or behavior profiling mechanisms.</li>
<li>There are no hidden background processes or network communications initiated by the system for the purpose of gathering user information.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, AnduinOS is fundamentally privacy-preserving by design.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="2-why-local-execution-matters">2. Why Local Execution Matters</h2>
<p>Local execution means that all features and services of AnduinOS are performed <strong>entirely on your computer</strong>, without requiring communication with any external servers owned by us or third parties.<br>This ensures:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Control:</strong> You retain complete control over your personal data.</li>
<li><strong>Transparency:</strong> No data leaves your machine without your explicit action.</li>
<li><strong>Security:</strong> Reducing external communications limits exposure to interception or exploitation risks.</li>
</ul>
<p>In a world where remote telemetry has become ubiquitous, AnduinOS deliberately minimizes external dependencies to protect users.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="3-open-source-guarantees-your-freedom">3. Open Source Guarantees Your Freedom</h2>
<p>AnduinOS is distributed under the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html">GNU General Public License v3.0 (GPL-v3)</a>.<br>This license guarantees:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Freedom to inspect:</strong> You can review the source code to verify there are no hidden tracking mechanisms.</li>
<li><strong>Freedom to modify:</strong> You can adjust the code to suit your needs, including removing any components you distrust.</li>
<li><strong>Freedom to redistribute:</strong> You can share AnduinOS, either modified or unmodified, under the same license terms.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The open nature of AnduinOS empowers users to independently verify that the system respects their privacy.</strong><br>There are no proprietary blobs or closed modules outside of upstream dependencies explicitly inherited from Ubuntu.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="4-upstream-software-and-privacy-considerations">4. Upstream Software and Privacy Considerations</h2>
<p>While AnduinOS itself does not collect any data, <strong>it integrates a wide range of upstream open-source software</strong> originating from Ubuntu, Debian, GNOME, Flathub, and other sources.<br>(Some examples and references can be found <a href="https://gitlab.aiursoft.cn/anduin/anduinos/-/blob/1.4/OSS.md?ref_type=heads">here</a>).</p>
<p>Some upstream components may have independent data collection mechanisms.<br>Notably:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Canonical Ltd.</strong> (Ubuntu&#39;s developer) may collect certain system information for statistics and diagnostics purposes via tools like:<ul>
<li><code>ubuntu-report</code></li>
<li><code>popularity-contest</code></li>
<li>Snap store background services (if Snap is manually installed by users)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We strongly recommend users review Canonical’s <a href="https://ubuntu.com/legal/data-privacy">Privacy Policy</a> for details.</p>
<p>AnduinOS does <strong>not</strong> modify, enhance, or introduce additional telemetry into these upstream components.<br>It merely redistributes them in their original, unmodified state.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="5-how-to-handle-potential-ubuntu-telemetry">5. How to Handle Potential Ubuntu Telemetry</h2>
<p><strong>AnduinOS does not preinstall any telemetry-related packages</strong> such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>popularity-contest</code></li>
<li><code>ubuntu-report</code></li>
<li><code>apport</code></li>
<li><code>whoopsie</code></li>
<li>Snap daemon</li>
<li>Canonical Livepatch service</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, by default, <strong>AnduinOS does not participate in any system reporting, usage statistics submission, or automated crash reporting</strong>.</p>
<p>However, if you manually install packages from Ubuntu repositories or enable certain Ubuntu-specific features, some of these telemetry mechanisms may be introduced.</p>
<p>To ensure full opt-out, you can review and, if necessary, remove these packages using:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash">sudo apt <span class="hljs-built_in">remove</span> popularity-contest ubuntu-report apport whoopsie
`
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><code>popularity-contest</code></strong>: Periodically submits anonymous package usage statistics.</li>
<li><strong><code>ubuntu-report</code></strong>: Collects basic hardware and software details at installation time.</li>
<li><strong><code>apport</code> &amp; <code>whoopsie</code></strong>: Automated error reporting services.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If these packages are not installed (as is the case with a clean AnduinOS installation), no action is required.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>AnduinOS is committed to keeping your installation clean and telemetry-free by default.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="6-responsibility-clarification">6. Responsibility Clarification</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>AnduinOS is a community-driven, non-profit project</strong> maintained in spare time by volunteers.</li>
<li><strong>AnduinOS does not have a data collection infrastructure</strong> and does not share any information with governments, corporations, or any third parties.</li>
<li><strong>For privacy concerns related to third-party applications,</strong> please refer to their respective upstream privacy policies.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>AnduinOS is built to maximize your freedom, security, and privacy.
We firmly believe that respecting users&#39; data is a fundamental responsibility, not a marketing feature.</p>
